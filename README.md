# cli-project

### CLI project for the Java MasterClass with Amigoscode
The cli-project is a capstone project made during the last few months. From the end of 2022 and lately updated in 2023.

### The dev branch bootstrap project

The dev branch contains all the first part of the project. 

### The branch interfaces
The branch interfaces contains the last update of my work with interfaces. There's still room for improvements like adding useful methods for each ArrayDataAccessService class:
* Delete users/cars/booking
* Update users/cars/booking

### Next branch coming dependency injection

### Streams

### Tests
